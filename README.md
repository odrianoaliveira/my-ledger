To build or run the project, use one of the following tasks:

| Task                          | Description                                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew check`             | Build and run the tests                                              |
| `run`                         | Run the server                                                       |

If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:
